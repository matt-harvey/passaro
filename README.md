# Passaro

Passaro is a toy time-tracking application that I made using AngularJS and
PouchDB. It is not intended for production use.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma (such as they are...).

## Deployment

Run `grunt build`. Then copy the contents of dist/ to a web server.
